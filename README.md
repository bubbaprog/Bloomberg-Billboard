Bloomberg Billboard Generator

[As seen in action here.](https://ilovecitr.us/bloomberg/)

By request, publishing this to Github. I realize it would work much better if written in Python. If you want to try that, please do. I was in a hurry and so reused much of the [Sam Darnold Injury Generator](https://ilovecitr.us/darnold/) which is also written as a bash script because it utilizes ffmpeg, which from my experience was very difficult to integrate with python. 

Prerequisites: Imagemagick.
